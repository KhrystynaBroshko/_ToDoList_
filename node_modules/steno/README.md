> Specialized fast async file writer

**Steno** makes writing to the same file often/concurrently fast and safe.

Used in [lowdb](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb).

_https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenotype_

## Features

- ⚡ Fast (see benchmark)
- 🐦 Lightweight (~6kb)
- 👍 ⚛️ Safe: No partial writes (writes are atomic)
- 👍 🏁 Safe: No race conditions (writes are ordered even if they're async)

# steno [![](http://img.shields.io/npm/dm/steno.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/steno)  [![](https://travis-ci.org/typicode/steno.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/typicode/steno)

> Simple file writer with __atomic writing__ and __race condition prevention__.

Can be used as a drop-in replacement to `fs.writeFile()`.

Built on [graceful-fs](https://github.com/isaacs/node-graceful-fs) and used in [lowdb](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb).

## Install

```
npm install steno --save
```
>>>>>>> d8454f4 (Add todo-api files)

## Usage

```javascript
<<<<<<< HEAD
import { Writer } from 'steno'

// Create a singleton writer
const file = new Writer('file.txt')

// Use it in the rest of your code
async function save() {
  await file.write('some data')
}
```

## Benchmark

`npm run benchmark` (see `src/benchmark.ts`)

```
Write 1KB data to the same file x 1000
  fs     :   62ms
  steno  :    1ms

Write 1MB data to the same file x 1000
  fs     : 2300ms
  steno  :    5ms
```

_Steno uses a smart queue and avoids unnecessary writes._
=======
const steno = require('steno')

steno.writeFile('file.json', data, err => {
  if (err) throw err
})
```

## The problem it solves

### Without steno

Let's say you have a server and want to save data to disk:

```javascript
var data = { counter: 0 }

server.post('/', (req, res) => {
  // Increment counter
  ++data.counter

  // Save data asynchronously
  fs.writeFile('data.json', JSON.stringify(data), err => {
    if (err) throw err
    res.end()
  })
})
```

Now if you have many requests, for example `1000`, there's a risk that you end up with:

```javascript
// In your server
data.counter === 1000

// In data.json
data.counter === 865 // ... or any other value
```

Why? Because, `fs.write` doesn't guarantee that the call order will be kept. Also, if the server is killed while `data.json` is being written, the file can get corrupted.

### With steno

```javascript
server.post('/increment', (req, res) => {
  ++data.counter

  steno.writeFile('data.json', JSON.stringify(data), err => {
    if (err) throw err
    res.end()
  })
})
```

With steno you'll always have the same data in your server and file. And in case of a crash, file integrity will be preserved.

if needed, you can also use `steno.writeFileSync()` which offers atomic writing too.

__Important: works only in a single instance of Node.__
